# iddoverse

## Purpose

To create analysis ready datasets (‘analysis datasets’) for researchers
using data stored in the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO)
respoitory.

These reusable functions aim to provide a toolbox for researchers to
modify the analysis dataset to their study-specific needs, speeding up
the time it takes to create analysable data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `iddoverse` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with the following code in the R console:

``` r
# if you have not previously installed 'devtools' on your machine
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Infectious-Diseases-Data-Observatory/iddoverse")
library(iddoverse)
```

We recommend re-installing regularly as the package is developing
constantly. Versions starting with ‘0.’ should be expected to change
without notification.

## Why is this useful?

The package assists researchers to transform their datasets (transferred
from IDDO), minimising the time spent on data transformation before
analysis can begin. These functions specifically work on SDTM (Study
Data Tabulation Model) data stored by IDDO.

Functions are documented and provide examples. A
[vignette](https://infectious-diseases-data-observatory.github.io/iddoverse/articles/iddoverse.html)
provides a demostration/tutorial of the functions and data in the
package.
