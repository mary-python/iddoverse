# Creates table of medical history features

Uses the IDDO-SDTM clinical and adverse events (SA) domain to create a
single dataset with various historic clinical information summarised.
Historic refers to events that occurred before the study start.

## Usage

``` r
create_clinical_hist_table(
  dm_domain,
  sa_domain,
  timing_variables = c("SAHR", "SADY", "SASTDY", "VISITDY", "VISITNUM", "VISIT", "EPOCH",
    "SAEVLINT", "SAEVINTX"),
  values_funct = first
)
```

## Arguments

- dm_domain:

  A demographics/DM domain data frame.

- sa_domain:

  A clinical and adverse events/SA domain data frame.

- timing_variables:

  Character list. List of timing variables which are to be used to
  separate time points, this is hierarchical so the order is taken into
  account. Default is: SAHR, SADY, SASTDY, VISITDY, VISITNUM, VISIT,
  EPOCH, SAEVLINT, SAEVINTX.

  (using default for example) Each row will be initially summarised
  based on the –HR (study hour) variable, if that is missing then the
  –DY (study day) variable is used, and so on. The output will be one
  row per participant, per time point, where the time point for each row
  is the first available variable listed in timing_variables.

- values_funct:

  Function. The function which will determine which data row is used in
  the output, in the event there are multiple rows for the same subject
  with the same time points (as listed in timing_variables). Default is
  first(), i.e. if there is two rows from the same day and time, the
  first record will be taken, the second will be dropped. Choice of
  timing_variables will impact the number of rows affected.

## Value

An analysis dataset, one row per person, per timepoint.

## Examples

``` r
create_clinical_hist_table(DM_RPTESTB, SA_RPTESTB)
#> [1] "Number of rows where values_fn has been used to pick record in the SA domain: 0"
#> Joining with `by = join_by(STUDYID, USUBJID)`
#> # A tibble: 1 × 6
#>   STUDYID USUBJID     TIME  TIME_SOURCE FEVER_PRESP FEVER_OCCUR
#>   <chr>   <chr>       <chr> <chr>       <chr>       <chr>      
#> 1 RPTESTB RPTESTB_001 -18   STDY        N           Y          

# Change which timing_variables are used to summarise the data
create_clinical_hist_table(DM_RPTESTB, SA_RPTESTB,
                           timing_variables = c("VISITDY", "EPOCH"))
#> [1] "Number of rows where values_fn has been used to pick record in the SA domain: 0"
#> Joining with `by = join_by(STUDYID, USUBJID)`
#> # A tibble: 1 × 6
#>   STUDYID USUBJID     TIME  TIME_SOURCE FEVER_PRESP FEVER_OCCUR
#>   <chr>   <chr>       <chr> <chr>       <chr>       <chr>      
#> 1 RPTESTB RPTESTB_001 1     VISITDY     N           Y
